Hockey Community's goal is to make hockey more social and accessible around the world. We help anyone in the hockey industry connecting with players, rinks, games and more! <br />

- Create a page for all of the teams you belong to and connect with all its members in one place.<br />
- Arrive at your rink and get the option to Check-In with the team you are playing with.<br />
- Discover the rinks around you and CHECK-IN. HC will then keep track of how many times you've played hockey around the world!
<br />
<br />
<b>New!</b> As of November 2012, the latest version of Hockey Community allows players to track how often they play, share events, check-ins or photos, and see what other people are doing with a newsfeed.<br />
